	<p>Ok &#8211; not quite a sell out as our tickets are free &#8211; but <strong>we have now given away all of the tickets to BarCamp London 8</strong>. Our waiting list is now also completely full, and we&#8217;ll be releasing tickets to those people as they become available.</p>
<p>We know that there are quite a few of you out there who haven&#8217;t managed to get a ticket. We&#8217;ve released more tickets than any other London BarCamp, and hope you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to attend in the future.</p>

<p>giffgaff is the UK’s first community-run mobile phone network.  With no call centres, contracts, shops or big budget TV advertising, the web 2.0 inspired business offers the public a genuine alternative to the existing big mobile networks.</p>
<p>Dubbed as &#8220;the Wikipedia of the mobile world&#8221;, giffgaff encourages customers to get involved and rewards them for every contribution they make. Community spirit earns points: this can include helping other members with queries, voicing opinions about how giffgaff should be run or simply spreading the word amongst their friends. Points are later exchanged for cash or a donation to a charity of the community’s choice.</p>
<p>With customers helping to manage everything from marketing to customer support, the network is affordable to all, without hidden charges and long contracts and where unlimited truly means unlimited.</p>

	<p><strong>We&#8217;re happy to announce that BarCamp London 8 will be held at City University in Clerkenwell this November 13th &#038; 14th. Below you will find answers to some questions you are bound to have, but if you have any more please email <a href="mailto:help@barcamplondon.org">help@barcamplondon.org</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Why November?</h2>
<p></strong>With summer fast approaching, we expect lots of people to be taking holidays and generally enjoying the great British weather. Also we want students from City University to be involved and November will be the first time the building is free in the new term. November also gives us plenty of time to plan for an awesome BarCamp London 8.</p>
<h2>How do I get a ticket and what happens to original BCL8 ticket holders?</h2>
<p>We will be announcing full ticketing details closer to the event, however we have guaranteed priority tickets for the 154 people who signed up for the original June date, and we expect to release a lot more to go along with them. Those with June tickets will receive an email during October with details on how this will work.</p>
<h2>Who are City University?</h2>
<p>City University London is a principal provider of undergraduate,  postgraduate, professional and vocational education in the United Kingdom. The University is committed to leading London in education, research and knowledge  transfer for businesses and the professions and is renowned for its international  focus and the employability of its graduates. </p>
<p>The University attracts over 21,000 students from 156 countries, while teaching staff are drawn from nearly 50 international locations, ensuring that the University has a truly  international outlook. City University London was founded in 1894 as the Northampton Institute and was awarded full university status in 1966. </p>
<p>Visit the  <a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/">City University web site</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>We will be holding an open meeting at 7pm on August 3rd at City University&#8217;s Social Sciences building and we invite anyone who&#8217;s interested in helping organise to come along. If you cant make the meeting don&#8217;t forget to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/barcamplondon8planning">join the planning group on Google</a>.</p>
<h2>I would like to sponsor, or pay for beer or t-shirts</h2>
<p><strong>Brilliant! We&#8217;d love to talk to you. Just drop <a href="mailto:cbetta@gmail.com">Cristiano an email</a> or call him on 07518 397784.</strong></p>
