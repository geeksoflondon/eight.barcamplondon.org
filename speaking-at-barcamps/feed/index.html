		<description>Hi Christiane

I thought this was a very useful article, particularly for people who have no experience of speaking in public. I particularly like your advice to talk about something you are very knowledgeable about (and/or are passionate about). Because nerves often take over when you&#039;re in front of a group (and perhaps a group of your peers are more daunting) doing this will reduce the likelihood to go into a blind panic when someone asks you a question on your chosen subject!

I also think it&#039;s a great idea to host a discussion or pick a problem and ask the group to help you solve it. As you mention, geeks love problem solving - and it&#039;s a brilliant way to encourage interaction and collaboration in the room. Gets the energy up, though I doubt that will be missing at BarCamp!

A couple of additional, practical tips if your readers do feel nervous about public speaking:-

- focus on your breathing, and try to do so deeply. It does really help you relax and think more clearly;

- talk more slowly than you want to - we all tend to speed up when we&#039;re nervous, especially when we are new to public speaking;

- concentrate on the people out there in the room and make eye contact with one or two of them, especially if they seem interested in your topic - this will help you not feel so self-conscious &amp; calm your nerves.

Enjoying your subject matter is really important, as it&#039;s usually rather infectious:-) So have fun!

All the best
