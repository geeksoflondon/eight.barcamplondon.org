		<description>@Felix - I can promise you there were a small number of tickets given out yesterday. However, demand is incredibly high and they sold out in a few seconds.

Hopefully you added yourself to the waiting list when you could, as the waiting list is full now too. May I wish you good luck for getting a ticket to BarCamp London 9!</description>

		<description>Were there even any tickets for round 3? I F5&#039;d at 10:00 and immediately the only option was the Add To Waitlist option. I&#039;d love to come, so please email me if there&#039;s something else I needed to do!</description>
